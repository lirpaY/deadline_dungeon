🕹️ Welcome to Deadline Dungeon 🕹️

A pixel of hope in a caffeinated chaos.

It’s 8:00 PM. Your assignment is due at 8:00 AM.

You're trapped in the ultimate boss battle: your own procrastination. Armed with caffeine, pure determination, and a dangerously low attention span, your mission is to code, debug, snack, and survive through the night.

But beware—distractions lurk in every shadow, and energy fades faster than your Wi-Fi connection.

Will you rise as a last-minute legend?

Or collapse on your keyboard in a tragic tale of “almost made it”?

Grab your hoodie. Power up your playlist. The dungeon awaits.
